# NimSimpleGuessingGame
GUI-based simple guessing game

A very simple number guessing game written in Nim using NiGui. I started learning Nim today, and made this the same day. Bugs include:
- Answer is always 88 (rand() function messing up, will look into this)
- Scrolling scrolls the whole window contents instead of submitted answers. There is no documentation of NiGui yet so I have no idea how to change this.

Please report any more bugs!

There are may ways to improve this I know, but it's my first GUI application outside Unreal Engine, and my first proper code application, so cut me some slack!

If you want to compile it yourself, you need NiGui, found here - https://github.com/simonkrauter/NiGui (sadly there is no documentation I could find except examples)
