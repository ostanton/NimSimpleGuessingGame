# NimSimpleGuessingGame
GUI-based simple guessing game

A very simple number guessing game written in Nim using NiGui. I started learning Nim and made this in one day. Bugs include:
- Answer is always 88 (rand() function messing up, will look into this)
- Scrolling scrolls the whole window contents instead of submitted answers. There is no documentation of NiGui yet so I have no idea how to change this.

Please report any more bugs!
